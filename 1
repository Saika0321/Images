Team Member Comments:
Since joining the team, my primary goal has been to grow into a confident and efficient contributor who consistently meets performance standards. I aim to continue developing my technical skills, deepen my understanding of our processes, and eventually take on greater responsibilities within the team and Global Payments.

From where I started in training to now actively handling live processing, I’ve seen steady progress in my confidence, accuracy, and efficiency. Training provided a strong foundation, and live experience has allowed me to apply what I’ve learned and improve through real-time feedback.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue learning, take part in more complex tasks, and contribute to process improvements. I hope to grow professionally and eventually mentor new team members, while also exploring long-term career growth opportunities within Global Payments.
